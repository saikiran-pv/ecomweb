# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the bin/rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: "Star Wars" }, { name: "Lord of the Rings" }])
#   Character.create(name: "Luke", movie: movies.first)

# Category.create(category_name: "Women", description: "Clothes for women")
# Category.create(category_name: "Men", description: "Clothes for men")
# Category.create(category_name: "Kids", description: "Clothes for kids")
# Category.create(category_name: "Accessories", description: "Wide ranges of accessories")
